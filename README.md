# ER-Model-and-Database for Movies

This Assignment is done as a part of CS -504 Data mining course. We have to make Database from scratch.

I have started with ER diagram by hand with given specifics by our Professor.
Then created data model for each tables followed by creating Tables in Mysql plus.
Then Tables were filled with data and fetched different records from it.
